My title for today’s talk is “Running the Race: Christian Life According to the Saint Paul.” Our focus for this series of talks is “Realizing the Kingdom of Heaven.” How do these two themes, the race and the kingdom, relate to each other? This question is difficult to answer because, as Alfred Loisy once observed, “Jésus annonçait le Royaume et c'est l'Église qui est venue.” To state the problem another way, Jesus speaks more often of the kingdom and Paul speaks more often of the church. On the rare occasions when Paul does mention the kingdom he presents it as something to be inherited rather than realized, and then in a cautionary way:

>Now the works of the flesh are obvious: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, anger, quarrels, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these. I am warning you, as I warned you before: those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God (Gal 5:19–21).

>Do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! Fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, sodomites, thieves, the greedy, drunkards, revilers, robbers—none of these will inherit the kingdom of God (1 Cor 6:9–10).

>What I am saying, brothers and sisters, is this: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable (1 Cor 15:50).

>Be sure of this, that no fornicator or impure person, or one who is greedy (that is, an idolater), has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God (Eph 5:5).

The quotation on the publicity for our sessions nicely captures an Orthodox perspective on the kingdom of heaven—“Where Christ is, there is the kingdom”—and yet, it is not self-evident from Saint Paul’s remarks either that we enter the kingdom whenever we step through the church doors, or even that we realize the kingdom when Christ is present with and in us. Paul gives us good reasons to question these kinds of assumptions, in fact. He even mocks the Corinthians for fancying that they reign with Christ:

>Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! Quite apart from us you have become kings! Indeed, I wish that you had become kings, so that we might be kings with you! (1 Cor 4:8).

Paul’s choice words for the Corinthians seem to echo Jesus’s remark that it’s easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom (Mark 10:25; Matt 19:24; Luke 18:), but wealth is only one of many obstacles that prevent us from realizing the kingdom. Whatever our relative income may be in this world of the 99 and one percent, it does not immunize us against greed, or strife, or jealousy, or anger, or quarrels, or dissensions, or factions, or envy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the list could go on. How then shall we live so as to receive our inheritance?

Lest I should seem to draw too strong a contrast between Jesus’s proclamation of the kingdom-at-hand and Paul’s perspective on the kingdom-to-come, I should note that even the gospels vary in their presentation of this theme. When we speak of the kingdom of heaven, for example, we are unconsciously using Matthew’s words. Mark and Luke prefer to call it the kingdom of God, and John rarely mentions it all. Again, when we address our Father *in heaven* we are praying with Matthew’s words and not Luke’s words. And again, when we pray “your kingdom come, *your will be done,*” we are praying with Matthew’s words. Luke omits the clause about the Father’s will. This does not mean that we must choose between radically different visions of the kingdom in each gospel, but it does compel us to look more closely than we might expect in order to see the common threads that bind the gospels to each other and to Paul’s letters.

For his part, Matthew shares Paul’s sense of a certain distance between us and the kingdom. The way there fraught with temptation, and success is not assured. It is Matthew’s Jesus who contrasts the narrow gate that leads to life with the wide gate that leads to destruction (Matt 7:13–14; cf. Luke 13:23). And again, it is Matthew who remembers Jesus telling his disciples that not everyone who says to him “Lord, Lord” will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of his Father who is in heaven (Matt 7:21; cf. Luke 6:46–47). These sayings ought to chasten us when we pray the Lord’s Prayer with Matthew’s words—“your kingdom come, *your will be done*”—because they suggest that what we are really asking for is the ability to follow the will of our Father who is in heaven and not our own will.

Fortunately we can look to Jesus himself, who in his final hours confides to three of his closest disciples that his soul is “deeply sorrowful to the point of death” and yet still finds the inner strength to submit his will to the will of the Father: “Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me, yet not as I will but as you will” (Matt 26:38–39; Mark 14:34–36). Here, too, the gospels vary in their presentation of the scene. Luke omits Jesus’s expression of anguish, and the closest parallel in John has Jesus decline to ask the Father to save him (Luke 22:41–42; John 12:27). What makes Matthew’s recollection of this moment truly distinctive, however, is the parallel between the “Lord’s Prayer” in Matthew 6 and the Lord’s prayer in Matthew 26. In this moment we see Jesus kneeling at the narrow gate and taking upon his own lips the prayer that he has taught to his disciples, “your will be done”. In this moment we see him kneeling on the threshold of the kingdom of heaven. In this moment we learn how how distressed he is in words that echo the psalm of lament: “Why are you so sorrowful, O soul, and why do you disturb me?” (Ps 41:6; cf. John 12:27).

The Church fathers agree that this moment shows us a Christ who is truly and fully human and not merely playing the part. To quote John Chrysostom:

>“ . . . He prays with earnestness, in order that the thing might not seem to be acting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp.&nbsp. For this cause also was this prayer. By saying then, “If it be possible, let it pass from me,” he showed his humanity; but by saying, “nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will,” he showed his virtue and asceticism, teaching us, even when nature pulls back, to follow God” (*Hom. in Matt.* 83 [*PG* 58.745–746]).

Several centuries later, Maximus the Confessor appeals to this same scene as evidence that Jesus simultaneously wills “in a fleshly way the shrinking back in the face of death” and yet remains perfectly in harmony with his divine will:

>And again he shows his eager desire, putting death to death in the flesh, in order that he might show as a human being that what is natural is saved in himself, and the might demonstrate, as God, the Father’s great and ineffable purpose, fulfilled in the body. For it was not primarily to suffer, but in order to save, that he became a human being. Therefore he said, *Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not mine, but your will be done;* showing, in the shrinking, the determination of the human will shaped and brought to be (in harmony with the divine will)&nbsp;.&nbsp.&nbsp. (*Opuscula* 3 [*PG* 91.48b], trans. Louth).

When I read these comments in preparation for today’s talk, I could not help but think that something of Jesus’s original anguish gets lost in the translation from scripture to doctrine. For Chrysostom, as for Maximus, Jesus emerges from Gethsemene as an ascetical hero, resolutely and even eagerly transforming his fear of death into a philosophical virtue. Maximus’s interpretation, in particular, paved the way for the definition of faith composed by the fathers of the sixth ecumenical council in the year 681. This definition states, in part, that in Christ there are two natural wills that are not contrary to each other, “but his human will follows and that not as resisting and reluctant, but rather as subject to his divine and omnipotent will.” It is difficult to see how Jesus’s fear of death does not translate to resistance or reluctance to follow the divine will, and yet this is exactly what Maximus and the fathers of the sixth council would ask us to believe.

Upon closer inspection, however, I see that both Chrysostom and Maximus use language not far removed from the very psalm of lament that Jesus himself echoes in Gethsemene: “Why are you so sorrowful, O soul, and why do you disturb me” (Ps 41:6). The psalmist describes as a ‘disturbance’ of the soul what Chrysostom calls a ‘pulling back’, and what Maximus refers to as ‘shrinking back’. All of this language evokes an image of the soul that goes all the way back to Plato and persists well beyond the end of classical antiquity. This image depicts the soul as a charioteer, and it is here that we can discern the common threads connecting Jesus’s announcement of the heavenly kingdom to Paul’s emphasis on running the race.

The image of the soul as a charioteer finds its definitive expression on one of Plato’s dialogues, the *Phaedrus* (246a–﻿256e). Here, Plato compares the soul to a charioteer driving a team of winged horses, one of which is good while the other is wicked. When the charioteer sees the soul’s beloved and pulls the horses to their haunches, the wicked horse drags the team forward whilst wildly “champing at the bit” (ἐνδακὼν τὸν χαλινόν, Phaedr. 254d). By the first century, the two horses in this scene had come represent the soul and the body, and so a contemporary of Paul named Plutarch mentions struggling with the body when it is “biting and straining” (δάκνοντος καὶ κατατείνοντος, *Tu. san.* 125b, with 137e for context; cf. Plato, *Tim.* 88B). Elsewhere, Plutarch alludes to the same scene in the Phaedrus when he explains why moderation is superior to self-mastery: “For biting (τὸ δάκνον), distress, and anger have not yet left self-mastery, but the soul of the moderate person is steady on all sides, not impulsive, and healthy, by which ready obedience the irrational is harmonized and united with the rational and equipped with remarkable gentleness” (*Virt. mor.* 446c–﻿d, with 445c for context; cf. Gal 5:22–﻿23, 6:1).
