Today is the first Sunday of Lent for Eastern Orthodox Christians. This is the Sunday when we celebrate the restoration of icons by the Holy Fathers of the Seventh Ecumenical Council, the second such council to be held at the seaside town of Nicaea in northwest Turkey. Nicaea II convened in the year 787 C.E., nearly 500 years after the First, and more famous, Council of Nicaea. Together, the two councils summarize the fullness of Orthodox devotion to Jesus. Why this is so, however, tends to escape the casual observer and occasional reader of pulp religion.

Take the warring titles of two popular books on Jesus, for example: *How Jesus Became God* and *How God Became Jesus.*
