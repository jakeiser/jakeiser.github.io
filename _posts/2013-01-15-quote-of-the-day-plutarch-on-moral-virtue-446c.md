“The wise person is not self-mastered but moderate, nor does the fool lack self-mastery but moderation. For the one takes pleasure in what is honourable, while the other is not troubled by shameful things. Lack of self-mastery, therefore, is the mark of a sophistic soul having reason but not the ability to stand by the things that it has correctly discerned” (Plutarch, *On Moral Virtue* 446c).
