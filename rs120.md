### Course Description

This course<!--excerpt.start--> introduces the Christian scriptures and the major Christian traditions, both as they relate to the monotheistic traditions of Judaism and to each other. The course is divided into three units covering the biblical foundations of Christianity, medieval developments, and modern challenges. This study will be conducted academically, so no particular religious affiliation is presumed or necessary<!--excerpt.end-->.

### Course Objectives

Students in this course will:

1. gain an understanding of contemporary methods and presuppositions in the academic study of religion;
2. learn to read the Bible and other assigned texts critically and contextually;
3. become familiar with key persons, events, and movements in the history of Christianity;

### Course Requirements

1. *<span style="text-decoration: underline">Attendance and Participation:</span>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular attendance will be reflected in your final grade. I acknowledge, however, that some absences are unavoidable; please notify me in advance of such absences whenever possible. In addition to attendance, your grade for the course will incorporate the following components:

   *Reading:*&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrive in class with the assigned readings in hand, having read and annotated them in advance so that you are prepared for discussion.

   *Active Participation:*&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen, make notes, ask questions, and contribute to class discussions.
   
2. *<span style="text-decoration: underline">In-Class Exercises and Quizzes:</span>*&nbsp;&nbsp;You will be required to participate in a variety of in-class exercises, either individually or in groups. As well, short quizzes will test your comprehension of class discussions and/or assigned readings. In order to receive credit for an exercise or quiz, you must be present on the day it is assigned and ensure that you turn it in with your full name on it. I will not offer make-up exercises or quizzes.

3. *<span style="text-decoration: underline">Thinking Pieces:</span>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of the semester you must complete five thinking pieces. These are short assignments based on the readings. In some cases the assignment will require that you compare and contrast different readings or answer a set of questions. In other cases you will write up a response to a question concerning a reading. These responses should be no more than two pages (roughly 500 words of typed, double-spaced text in 12-point Times New Roman or the equivalent). Depending on the nature of the assignment, you must turn in a hardcopy in class or upload your response to Canvas prior to the start of class.

4. *<span style="text-decoration: underline">Church Visit Report:</span>*&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to Wednesday, March 30 you must attend a major weekend service of a church service of your choosing, excluding the denomination in which you were raised or with which you are currently affiliated. This exclusion does not apply if you have no Christian background or affiliation. During your visit you should make careful observations of the service. Write up your notes immediately afterward. A 3–5 page paper detailing your observations will be due on **Monday, April 4**. Additional details are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rdEUrqzx3pcHofRuEaXB2D6cDv-hXghbjJRxM1JD-GQ/edit?usp=sharing).
