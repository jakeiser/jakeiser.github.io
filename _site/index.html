Several weeks ago I met with a few friends for an ongoing discussion of William James’s classic Gifford Lectures, <em><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080727010425/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/JamVari.html">The Varieties of Religious Experience</a>.</em> One of our criticisms of James concerns his assumption that psychological phenomena recur unchanged over millennia. This came up again in our discussion of James’s lectures on conversion. As a New Testament scholar, I wondered why James skips lightly over Saint Paul’s conversion.

The theme of teaching and discipleship provides a helpful way to think about theosis. For many of the Eastern Fathers the Incarnation teaches not only that human nature <em>can</em> be deified but that deification is ultimately what God intended for human beings.

            The most frequently cited text in discussions of becoming god is Psalm 82:6 (81:6 in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures). A single verse is admittedly a weak foundation for an entire tradition, even by the standards of patristic exegesis, so let’s look more closely at this psalm in its historical, canonical, and traditional contexts.

Lent challenges us to look <em>inward</em> in an age when we are more inclined to extend ourselves <em>outward</em> in ever-expanding social networks. In an age of information without understanding, of breadth without depth, Lent is our time to contemplate what is the breadth and length and height and depth of the love of God, that we may be filled up to all the fullness of God (Eph 3:18–19). Lent is our time for moral, intellectual, and spiritual conversion; only then will we realize our calling.

            The Damascus road is not about Judaism or Christianity; it is not about Law or Gospel; it is not about works or faith. It is about abject blindness in the face of glory; it is about hearing and heeding the words of the Lord. It is about being converted <em>and</em> being called, so before we ask what it means to be called we ought to ponder carefully what it means to be converted.

Received wisdom and collective memory tell us that a Damascus road experience is a radical about face, an epiphanic moment when all that one is and was dissolves in the stunning, catalytic rays of illumination—a conversion. Reality is more complicated. Some of us will never have such an experience this side of the grave. Others will not taste death before they see the Lord in his glory. The Church, in her wisdom, has given Lent to all of us.

Pat Robertson’s suggestion that Haiti has recently suffered a devastating earthquake because her founders allegedly made a pact with the Devil is a case in point. The theory of Justification, as Campbell construes it, provides an implicit rationale for such claims.

But has Campbell construed the theory correctly?
