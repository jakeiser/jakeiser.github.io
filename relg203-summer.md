### Course Description

Bart D. Ehrman recently called the Bible “the most frequently purchased, commonly read, passionately believed, and widely misunderstood book in the history of Western civilization.” <!--excerpt.start-->This course is designed to address the situation of most students knowing more about the Bible than they might think, but also being more confused about that inherited cultural knowledge than they might think. To this end, “Western culture” will be defined and outlined historically for the purposes of the class, as a family of cultures shaped by ideas of the sacred and the secular that were developed in conversation with Greco-Roman and biblical traditions. The class will then will review key examples of biblical tradition, and critical discussions of their place in Western culture<!--excerpt.end-->. **_Students will show they can notice biblical traditions at work in Western culture, and think about them critically—both on the spot in real time_** (in the class discussions and the Midterm exam) **_and in depth on their own time_** (in the Reflections). Section 1 (May 4–May 14) introduces the materials and problems involved in a Religious Studies approach to “the West” and to biblical traditions. Reflective engagement with the readings and ideas is expected. Section 2 (May 19–June 3) is more “hands-on” and thematic. Students are expected to come prepared for active discussions of key texts and interpretations.

### Required Texts 

1. A Bible, preferably a New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) with both “Old” and “New” Testaments, as well as the “Apocrypha.” The best choices for this class are Harold Attridge, et al., eds., *[The HarperCollins Study Bible, Student Edition](http://www.amazon.ca/Harpercollins-Study-Bible-Student-Revised/dp/0060786841/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1409422103&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=HarperCollins+Study+Bible%2C+Student+Edition),* (San Francisco, Calif.: HarperOne, 2006) and Michael Coogan, et al., eds., *[The New Oxford Annotated Bible with Apocrypha, College Edition](http://www.amazon.ca/Oxford-Annotated-Bible-Apocrypha-9530/dp/0195289609)* (4th ed.; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010).

   You may use the King James Version (KJV) as a companion to a modern version if you have a special interest in English literature. The KJV is an outdated and inaccurate translation by today’s standards, but it remains the most influential translation of the Bible into English.
   
   *Paraphrases or primarily “dynamic/functional equivalency” translations such as the Contemporary English Version (CEV), the Good News Bible (GNB), the Living Bible (LB), The Message, the New Living Translation (NLT), The Voice, and Todays English Version (TEV) are not adequate for this course. Please ask if you are unsure whether your version is acceptable.*
   
   Bibles can be purchased at the [Canadian Bible Society](http://maps.google.ca/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=Canadian+Bible+Society+Montreal&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;cid=0,0,3543729535322090350&amp;amp;ll=45.504828,-73.56941&amp;amp;spn=0.007564,0.019312&amp;z=16&amp;amp;iwloc=A) (located in the Cathedral Mall between St. Catherine and Maisonneuve) or generally at any bookstore.

2. Riches, John, *The Bible. A Very Short Introduction* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000)

3. Additional readings are listed for some classes. These readings are accessible through links on the course schedule.
   
   *NOTE: You will be responsible for reading all of the texts assigned for each lecture prior to class, so organize your time accordingly and come prepared. Lectures, discussions, and other class activities will assume that you have done this prep work. Informed, thoughtful engagement with the required assigned readings must also be demonstrated in the reading reflections/questions.*

### Course Requirements

Attendance is mandatory. Your comprehension and critical engagement with the assigned readings and lectures will be evaluated, so come prepared. Your grade in the course will be based on the following elements:

1. *<span style="text-decoration: underline">Reading Reflections:</span>*&#160;&#160;For this course you must complete four (4) Reading Reflections/Questions. These are short assignments that encourage critical engagement with the assigned readings and other course materials. Each reflection should not exceed two pages (approximately 500 words) of typed, double-spaced text in 12-point Times New Roman or an equivalent font. If you  consult outside sources, you must cite them in the body of your paper using the author-date system, e.g. (Maritain 74–75). Give full bibliographic information in a List of Works Cited at the end of your paper. Consult the [essays and papers](https://www.mcgill.ca/religiousstudies/current/papers#style) page of the Faculty of Religious Studies for examples of author-date citations and corresponding entries in reference lists.
   
   Unless otherwise instructed, you must upload each thinking piece to MyCourses prior to the beginning of class on the day it is due. Each piece will be given a score of 0–5 points. Late assignments will be reduced by one point for each day they are late. You may consult the grading rubric for these assignments by clicking on the “Rubrics” link on MyCourses.
   
2. *<span style="text-decoration: underline">Midterm:</span>*&#160;&#160;A midterm exam will be administered in class on **May 18**.

3. *<span style="text-decoration: underline">Final Exam:</span>*&#160;&#160;A final exam will be administered in class on **June 02.**

   *You are responsible to arrive in class promptly on the day of the exam. In case of an emergency, appropriate documentation explaining your absence must be submitted to the instructor. If the absence is officially excused, an alternative exam will be administered at a mutually-agreeable time. Otherwise the absence will be regarded as unexcused and the mark entered as a zero.*

### Summary of Course Requirements

1. Reading Reflections (4 x 10%): 40%
2. Midterm Exam: 30%
3. Final Exam: 30%
